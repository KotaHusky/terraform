# Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you manage Kubernetes applications. Helm uses a packaging format called **charts**, which are collections of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. Helm releases are instances of charts that have been deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Helm Releases

Helm releases are instances of charts that have been deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. When you install a chart using Helm, it creates a release with a unique name and version. You can then manage the release using Helm commands, such as upgrading or rolling back the release.

## Helm Releases in Kubernetes

Helm releases are stored in the Kubernetes cluster as custom resources. Each release is represented by a `HelmRelease` custom resource, which contains metadata about the release, such as the chart name, version, and values. The `HelmRelease` resource also contains a status field that indicates the current state of the release, such as whether it is deployed or failed.

## Helm Releases in GitOps

In a GitOps workflow, Helm releases are managed using Git repositories. The desired state of the Kubernetes cluster is stored in a Git repository, and changes to the cluster are made by updating the repository. When a change is made to the repository, a GitOps tool such as Argo CD or Flux CD automatically deploys the change to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Helm Releases in CI/CD

In a CI/CD pipeline, Helm releases are managed using automation tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI. When a change is made to the code repository, the CI/CD tool automatically builds and tests the code, and then deploys the change to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
